# Instructions

This is a template Packt/Gitbook project. First, make sure you have node.js installed. Second, make sure you have the `gitbook-cli` installed. You can do this by using the command `npm install gitbook-cli`. The next step is to fork this project, navigate to it in the command line, and run `gitbook install`. This should automatically install all dependencies required (defined in book.json). Running `gitbook build` will then compile the static website assets.

This is as much as you need to get started.
